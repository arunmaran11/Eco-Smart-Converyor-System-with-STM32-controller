# Eco-Smart-Converyor-System-with-STM32-controller
This project addresses the issue of continuous conveyor operation leading to unnecessary electrical energy wastage. By implementing a solution using the STM32 microcontroller, which is significantly more cost-effective than traditional PLCs, we aim to optimize energy usage while maintaining full control over the conveyor system.
